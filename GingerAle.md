# Ginger Ale Syrup

## Dangerously Delicious
This recipe is dangerous - especially on a hot summer's day. But I'm convinced it's healthier than anything you'll buy in a store, and unless you buy the bargain bin, no-frills gingerish-colour-ale they sell in the knock-off supermarkets - it's probably cheaper. 

I'm currently working on using a pressure cooker to increase the yield of syrup to ginger and perhaps get a bit more ginger flavour out.


## Ingredients
375g Sugar - white or mix of white and light brown
170g (ish) of peeled & chopped ginger
Rind of 1 lemon (ish)
1 litre water

## Preparation
Chop ginger, peel lemon rind and measure sugar.

## Cook
Boil ginger and lemon rind in the water in a covered saucepan. Bring to the boil quite quickly (med-high) and turn down to low when boiling.  

After about 10 minutes add the sugar while stirring to make sure it's all dissolved.

## Reduce
Turn the heat up to medium and reduce to approximately 750ml of total liquid volume (about 3/4 reduction)

## Cool
Strain the solids out and cool to room temperature and then in the fridge for an hour. I eat the lemon rind immediately while it's warm and keep the sweet, cooked ginger as a palette cleanser or to add to yoghurt or desserts that need a little livening up.

## Serve
For a 250ml glass add about 40ml and a few cubes of ice, a good dash of lemon juice, preferably a slice of fresh lemon and a mint leaf or two. Top-up with sparkling water. Give it a stir and crush the mint leaf a little with a muddler or teaspoon.
