#'Italian sausage' pasta sauce
#This recipe works really well with  spaghetti which is all I can buy here in Japan at a reasonable price but if you can get a 'wider' pasta such as tagliatelli it'll be even better.

.tomato sauce (I like to make a lot and freeze some)
1tbsp olive oil
1 onion
1 or 2 sticks of celery
1 to 3 cloves of garlic (or more if you like:D but definitely not less..well unless you're alergic or something)
1/4 - 1tsp of dry chilli / chilli flakes - depends how hot you like it and how hot your chillies are, don't make it too spicy
 
1 tbsp tomato puree
3 x 400g tomato cans
A little sugar & salt & pepper

.Method
First gently saute the onion and celery in the olive oil.  Use the pan lid if its getting too hot, the steam will cool it down.

Add the garlic either finely chopped or totally smooshed with a little salt.

Cook for about 2 minutes, gently.

Add tomatoes first paste then cans or vice-versa whichever you like.  Keep the heat gentle and bring to a simmer.  

Simmer for a long time...gently..a long time...a really long time, like 2 or 3 hours.  It will taste better.

Add a little sugar, unless your tomatoes are super sweet and salt & pepper to taste.


.'Italian' sausage
This sausage is not really Italian, I'm sorry to all my Italian friends.  You have many wonderful and delicious sausage shaped pork products that are traditional and delicious.  This is my estimation of something to try to acheive an essence of Italian cuisine where I live (in asia).  Forgive me, please.

For 2 hungry people:
200g pork mince
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar
1/2 tsp ground 
1 tsp dry oregano
1/2 tsp sugar
1/3 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper (finely ground)
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
Chilli flakes (to taste)

Nb. I would add chilli here rather than more in the tomato sauce if you like spicy things!

.method
Mix all the ingredients except the pork, then add the pork and mix well...Use your hands to really mix it up.

Cover and leave in the refridgerator for a while 1hour - 1 day


*Putting it all together*
I like to use eringi (Japanese) known as trumpet mushrooms in the UK
Boil water for pasta
Cut the mushroom(s) into approximately 3mm cubes.
Brown the pork (sausage) in a little oil
Add the mushroom (and a little butter if you like)
*This is a good point to cook your pasta*
Add some tomato sauce.

Toss in the cooked pasta and serve with some chopped parsely and black olive and parmaggiano reggiano!  A few rocket leaves add a peppery spicy twang and a lovely colour.
